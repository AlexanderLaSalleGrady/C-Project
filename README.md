# C-Projects

Mattis Auto Wash:

Description: This project was inspired by my co-workers with the purpose of 
 double checking deposit paperwork at the end of a shift. This program is a simplified version 
 of what cashiers had to record at the end of a shift. Each textbox is used for user input.
 Every label is not accessable therefore prices and totals cannot be manually changed.  2nd 
 Car values must subtract and equal total cars entered.  Input X values only for 1st shift.
 Total amount to be deposited is displayed at the bottom of the form.
